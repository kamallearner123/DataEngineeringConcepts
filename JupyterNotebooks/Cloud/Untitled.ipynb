    "### What Are MCS Locks?\n",
    "\n",
    "MCS locks are a **spinlock variant** introduced by John M. Mellor-Crummey and Michael L. Scott in 1989. They are designed to address the problem of **cache-line bouncing** and poor scalability in traditional spinlocks, where multiple threads busy-wait (spin) on a single shared memory location, causing excessive cache coherence traffic. MCS locks achieve better performance in high-contention scenarios by organizing waiting threads into a queue, where each thread spins on a **local variable** in its own memory, reducing cache contention.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Features of MCS Locks:\n",
    "1. **Queue-Based Locking**:\n",
    "   - Threads attempting to acquire the lock form a queue, with each thread linked to the next.\n",
    "   - Only the thread at the head of a queue holds the lock; others wait their turn.\n",
    "2. **Local Spinning**:\n",
    "   - Each waiting thread spins on a **local flag** (usually in its own cache line), avoiding contention on a single shared lock variable.\n",
    "3. **Fairness**:\n",
    "   - MCS locks are **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)**, ensuring threads acquire the lock in the order they requested it, preventing starvation.\n",
    "4. **Scalability**:\n",
    "   - By reducing cache-line bouncing, MCS locks perform well in systems with many cores or threads compared to simple test-and-set spinlocks.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### How MCS Locks Work\n",
    "\n",
    "An MCS lock consists of two main components:\n",
    "1. **Lock Structure**: A pointer to the tail of the queue of waiting threads.\n",
    "2. **Per-Thread Node**: Each thread has a node (a structure) containing:\n",
    "   - A ```:disable-run\n",
    "`next`\n",
    "``` pointer to the next thread’s node in the queue.\n",
    "   - A ```:disable-run\n",
    "`locked`\n",
    "``` flag indicating whether the thread has acquired the lock.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lock Acquisition:\n",
    "1. A thread creates its own node with ```:disable-run\n",
    "`locked = true`\n",
    "``` (indicating it’s waiting) and ```:disable-run\n",
    "`next = NULL`\n",
    "```.\n",
    "2. The thread atomically swaps its node with the lock’s ```:disable-run\n",
    "`tail`\n",
    "``` pointer using a ```:disable-run\n",
    "`compare-and-swap`\n",
    "``` (CAS) or similar operation.\n",
    "3. If the previous ```:disable-run\n",
    "`tail`\n",
    "``` was ```:disable-run\n",
    "`NULL`\n",
    "```, the thread acquires the lock immediately (```:disable-run\n",
    "`locked`\n",
    "``` is set to ```:disable-run\n",
    "`false`\n",
    "```).\n",
    "4. Otherwise, the thread links itself to the previous tail’s ```:disable-run\n",
    "`next`\n",
    "``` pointer and spins on its own ```:disable-run\n",
    "`locked`\n",
    "``` flag, waiting for the previous thread to release the lock.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lock Release:\n",
    "1. The thread checks if its node’s ```:disable-run\n",
    "`next`\n",
    "``` pointer is ```:disable-run\n",
    "`NULL`\n",
    "``` (no waiting threads).\n",
    "2. If ```:disable-run\n",
    "`next`\n",
    "``` is ```:disable-run\n",
    "`NULL`\n",
    "```, it atomically sets the lock’s ```:disable-run\n",
    "`tail`\n",
    "``` to ```:disable-run\n",
    "`NULL`\n",
    "``` using CAS, indicating the lock is free.\n",
    "3. If ```:disable-run\n",
    "`next`\n",
    "``` is not ```:disable-run\n",
    "`NULL`\n",
    "```, the thread sets the ```:disable-run\n",
    "`locked`\n",
    "``` flag of the next thread’s node to ```:disable-run\n",
    "`false`\n",
    "```, signaling that the next thread can acquire the lock.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pseudo-Code Example:\n",
    "```c\n",
    "struct mcs_node {\n",
    "    struct mcs_node *next;\n",
    "    bool locked;\n",

    "    my_node->next = NULL;\n",
    "    my_node->locked = true;\n",
    "    // Atomically swap my_node with lock->tail\n",
    "    struct mcs_node *prev = atomic_exchange(&lock->tail, my_node);\n",
    "    if (prev != NULL) {\n",
    "        // Queue is non-empty, link to previous node\n",
    "        prev->next = my_node;\n",
    "        // Spin on local flag\n",
    "        while (my_node->locked) { /* busy wait */ }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    // Lock acquired\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "void mcs_unlock(struct mcs_lock *lock, struct mcs_node *my_node) {\n",
    "    if (my_node->next == NULL) {\n",

    "        if (atomic_compare_exchange(&lock->tail, &my_node, NULL)) {\n",
